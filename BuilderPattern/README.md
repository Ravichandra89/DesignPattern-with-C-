# Builder Pattern

## Overview

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

This repository provides an example implementation of the Builder Pattern in C++, along with an algorithmic representation to help understand its structure and usage.

## Implementation

### 1. Product Class

The `Product` class represents the complex object being constructed. It may include properties and methods relevant to the final product.

### 2. Builder Interface

The `Builder` interface declares methods for each step involved in constructing the product. It also includes a method to get the constructed product.

```cpp
class Builder {
public:
    virtual void buildStep1() = 0;
    virtual void buildStep2() = 0;
    // ... (other steps)
    virtual Product* getResult() = 0;
};
```
3. ConcreteBuilder Classes
ConcreteBuilder classes implement the Builder interface. They provide specific implementations for each step in constructing the product and keep a reference to the product being constructed.

class ConcreteBuilder : public Builder {
public:
    void buildStep1() override { /* ... */ }
    void buildStep2() override { /* ... */ }
    // ... (implement other steps)
    Product* getResult() override { /* return the constructed product */ }
};

4. Director Class
The Director class is responsible for directing the construction process using a specific builder. It holds a reference to the Builder interface.

class Director {
private:
    Builder* builder;

public:
    void setBuilder(Builder* newBuilder) {
        builder = newBuilder;
    }

    void constructProduct() {
        builder->buildStep1();
        builder->buildStep2();
        // ... (invoke other steps)
    }
};

5. Client Code
In the client code, choose a ConcreteBuilder based on the desired product variation. Create an instance of the Director and set the chosen ConcreteBuilder. Use the Director to construct the product, invoking the builder's methods step by step. Retrieve the constructed product from the builder.

ConcreteBuilder concreteBuilder;
Director director;
director.setBuilder(&concreteBuilder);
director.constructProduct();
Product* product = concreteBuilder.getResult();
